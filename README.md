Spaghetti Coin is a cryptocurrency that is based on the scrypt algorithim. To ask any questions contact admin@wanshow.tips

To start Mining:

Download the wallet <a href="https://github.com/baxtmann/spaghetticoin/raw/master/spaghetti-qt.exe">Here</a>
Next, Launch the wallet, let it run for about 30 seconds, and then close it again.
Once you have closed it, go to your C drive, then users, then your username, then, appdata, then roaming, and find the folder named spaghetti coin. Once you get to there, create a file called "spaghetti.conf"

Inside that file create the following commands: 

**Make sure to remember your username and password!**
<br>
<br>rpcuser=YOUR_USERNAME
<br>rpcpassword=YOUR_PASSWORD
<br>rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
<br>rpcport=4210
<br>listen=1
<br>server=1
<br>addnode=node.walletbuilders.com
<br>
Then, click save on the file and close it. Now we will set up the miner.

1. Download the miner: <a href="https://github.com/baxtmann/spaghetticoin/raw/master/pooler-cpuminer-2.5.0-win64.zip">Here</a>

2. Extract the miner

3. Now edit the file named "mine.bat" 
    In there: add your username and password! Note: Leave the colon between the username and the password!
    
4. Now to mine, first launch the wallet, and then launch mine.bat

Note: The wallet must always be open when mining, because it uses the wallet to connect to the node so that it can mine!
